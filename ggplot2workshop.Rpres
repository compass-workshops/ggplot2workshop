Workshop Preliminaries
========================================================
type: section

1. Workshop Requirements
2. Installing and loading ggplot2
3. Our Research Question
4. Roadmap for the Workshop

1. Workshop Requirements
========================================================
type: sub-section

Before You Begin
========================================================

1. You have access to a laptop computer and Internet service
2. You have downloaded and installed R with RStudio
3. You have downloaded the R Workshop files:
 + `States.RData`
 + `ggplot2workshop.html`

**Go to**: [https://compass-workshops.github.io/info/](https://compass-workshops.github.io/info/)

2. Installing and Loading ggplot2
========================================================
type: sub-section

The Power of R and R Packages
========================================================

- Since R is free and open-source, lots of people are writing R packages
- An R package is just a collection of R functions, data, and code in a well-defined format
- R packages can do everything from text mining (`tm` package) to data visualzation (`ggplot2` package) to data wrangling (`dplyr` package)
- Over 9,000 R packages as of 2016 on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)

Installing Packages in RStudio
========================================================

- To install R packages in RStudio: GUI versus R Console
- 1. Using the GUI: Go to the `Packages` tab and click `Install`
- 2. Using the R Console: `install.packages("package_name")`
 - `package_name` is just the name of the R package in quotes
 -  Try this **R Code**: `install.packages("ggplot2")`

Loading an R Package For Use
========================================================

- Once you've installed an R package, it's then bundled with R and RStudio
- You now have access to all of the functions, data, code, and other files associated with the installed R package
- However, to access these files you must load your R package
 - Try this **R Code**: `library(ggplot2)`
- You only have to install an R package once, but you must load it every time you start R


3. Our Research Question
========================================================
type: sub-section

The 2008 Presidential Election
========================================================

![Obama and McCain](Images/ObamaMcCainFaces.png)

The Electoral College Map
========================================================

![Obama and McCain Map](Images/ObamaMcCainMap.png)

Examining the Election of 2008
========================================================

- Throughout this  workshop we will consider the following question:
 - **Why did some states go for Obama and others for McCain?**
- We'll explore this question using real data on 50 states
- In the process of answering this question we'll learn about visualizing data with ggplot2

4. Roadmap for the Workshop
========================================================
type: sub-section

What We'll Learn Today
========================================================

- **Part 1**: Histograms and Density Plots
- **Part 2**: Bar Plots and Faceting
- **Part 3**: Boxplots
- **Part 4**: Scatterplots
- **Part 5**: Spatial Mapping

Part 1: Histograms and Density Plots
========================================================
type: section

Mission #1:  Educational Differences in the United States
========================================================
type: prompt

* How does the percent who went to high school differ across regions? 
* Later we'll examine if education might help us understand variation in voting across the United States

* We'll use data to answer this question!


Loading Data into R
========================================================
- Let's load `States.RData` into our **workspace**
- Using RStudio's user-friendly interface:
 1. *File ---> Open File*
 2. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the files for this workshop (for example: `C:/Folder/`)

- You can also try this **R Code**:
```
load(C:/Folder/States.RData)
```

Viewing the Data as a Spreadsheet
========================================================
- Let's look at our data in more depth!
- Let's use the function `View()`
- Try this **R Code**:

```
View(States)
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What are the observational units of the data set? 
 - What variables look interesting or unusual to you?

Introducing the Grammar of Graphics
========================================================

- ggplot2 stands for Grammar of Graphics
- The idea behind ggplot2 is that it breaks down plotting into a set of distinct inputs
- There are two main functions in ggplot2: `qplot()` and `ggplot()`
- We will focus more on `qplot()`, which stands for "quick plot"
- `qplot()` is very powerful and has a similar syntax to the base R functions

Remember: Functions in R
========================================================

- The command `qplot()` is a **function**
- We will use functions a lot!
- A function takes one or more inputs (*raw meat*), does something to these inputs (*grinds it up*), and gives an output (*ground meat*)

***

![Meat Grinder](Images/MeatGrinder.jpg)

The Basics of the qplot Function
========================================================
class: small-code

- The `qplot()` function has the following syntax:

```
qplot(x, y, data, color, shape, size, facets, geom, stat)
```

- `x` and `y`: the variables to plot
- `data`: your data set
- `color`,`shape`, and `size`: aesthetic arguments
- `facets`: optional splitting (or "faceting") into subplots
- `geom`: the actual visualization of the data (such as `point` or `line`)
- `stat`: any statistical summaries to be applied 


Creating a Histogram: State Populations
========================================================
class: small-code
- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="histogram", bins=10)
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - How would you describe the distribution of income across states?
 - What are the inputs into this function?
 - What happens if you change the number of `bins = 10` to `bins=20` or `bins=5`?

Creating a Density Plot: State Populations
========================================================

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="density")
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - How would you describe the distribution of income across states?
 - What are the pros/cons of a density plot over a histogram?

Changing the Color 
========================================================
class: small-code
- We use the `I()` function to specify a particular color 
- The `I()` function tells ggplot2 that this is a color, not an R object in its own right 
- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="histogram", color=I("red"), bins=20)

qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="density", color=I("red"))
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What is the "color" option doing to our graphs? 
 - How do you change the color to "orange"?

Changing the Fill
========================================================
class: small-code
- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="histogram", fill=I("red"), bins=20)

qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="density", fill=I("red"))
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What is the "fill" option doing to our graphs? 
 - How do you change the **fill** to "orange"?


Population by McCain/Obama Outcome: Color
========================================================
class: small-code
- We can also specify the color in terms of another variable (typically categorical)
- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="histogram", color=ObamaMcCain, bins=20)

qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="density", color=ObamaMcCain)
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - Were states higher in population more likely to go for Obama or McCain?
 
Population by McCain/Obama Outcome: Fill
========================================================
class: small-code

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="histogram", fill=ObamaMcCain, bins=20)

qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="density", fill=ObamaMcCain)

```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What is a problem with the "fill" option, particularly for the density plot?

Adding Transparency to the Plots
========================================================
class: small-code

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="histogram", fill=ObamaMcCain, bins=20, alpha=I(0.5))

qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="density", fill=ObamaMcCain, alpha=I(0.5))

```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What happens if you change `alpha` to 0.2? How about 0.8?
 - What happens if you change `alpha` to 1? How about 0? 


Challenge #1: Educational Differences in the United States
========================================================
type: prompt
incremental: true
class: small-code

- How does the percent who went to high school differ across regions? 
- Create a density plot with ggplot2 to answer this question!
- **R Code** Hint:

```
qplot(data=States, x=HighSchool, geom="density", fill=Region, alpha=I(0.5))
```

Check-In #1: Density Plots and Histograms
========================================================
type: alert

- At this point you should have:
 - Loaded a data set into R
 - Created histograms and density plots
 - Explored the distribution of a continuous variable by levels of a categorical variable using the "fill" and "color" options
 - Altered the transparency of graphs using the "alpha" option


Part 2: Bar Plots and Faceting
========================================================
type: section

Mission #2: Rich State, Poor State, Red State, Blue State
========================================================
type: prompt

- What are the number of "rich" states that went for Obama compared to "poor"" states?
- To answer this question, we'll create bar plots


Creating a Categorical Variable
========================================================
class: small-code

- We will use the `recode` command from the `car` package
- You need to install the `car` R package and then load it
- Try this **R Code**:

```
install.packages("car")
library("car")

States$Rich <- car::recode(States$HouseholdIncome, "lo:55000='Poor'; 55001:hi = 'Rich'", as.factor.result=TRUE)

table(States$Rich)

```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What are the advantages and disadvantages of converting a continuous variable to a categorical variable?
 

Creating a Bar Plot with a Single Categorical Variable
========================================================

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Rich, geom="bar")
qplot(data=States, x=Rich, color=Rich, geom="bar")
qplot(data=States, x=Rich, fill=Rich, geom="bar")
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What is the difference between these plots?
 
Creating a Bar Plot with Two Categorical Variables
========================================================

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Rich, color=Region, geom="bar")

qplot(data=States, x=Rich, fill=Region, geom="bar")

```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What is the difference between these plots?
 - Which graph do you prefer?

Introduction to Faceting
========================================================

- Faceting entails creating sub-plots using values of one or more other variables
- These are sometimes called a trellis graphs, since there are many sub-plots that give the appearance of a trellis
- The syntax is `row_variable ~ column_variable`
- To create a trellis graph based on a single conditioning variable, use `row_variable ~ . ` or `. ~ column_variable`
- The `.` indicates that we're not conditioning on the rows or columns, respectively

Faceting with Bar Plots
========================================================
class: small-code

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data = States, x = Region, fill = Region, geom = "bar", facets = Rich ~ .)

qplot(data = States, x = Region, fill = Region, geom = "bar", facets = . ~ Rich)

qplot(data = States, x =Region, fill = Region, geom = "bar", facets = ObamaMcCain ~ Rich)
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - How many states are "rich", in the Northeast, and went for McCain? 
 - How many states are "rich", in the Northeast, and went for Obama?

Improving Plots with Axis Labels
========================================================
 
- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Rich, fill=Region, geom="bar", xlab="Income Category", ylab="Number of States")
```

- We can add axis labels to any qplot, not just bar plots

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="histogram", bins=10, xlab="Population (in Millions)", ylab="Number of States")
```

Improving Plots with a Main Title
========================================================

 
- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Rich, fill=Region, geom="bar", main="Bar Plot of Income Category by Region")
```

- We can add axis labels to any qplot, not just bar plots

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=Population, geom="histogram", bins=10, main="Histogram of Population")
```

Challenge #2: Rich State, Poor State, Red State, Blue State
========================================================
type: prompt
incremental: true

- What are the number of "rich" states that went for Obama compared to "poor" states?
- Create a bar plot with ggplot2 to answer this question

- **R Code** Hint:

```
qplot(data = States, x = Rich, fill = Rich, geom = "bar", facets = . ~ ObamaMcCain)
```
- Is this finding surprising to you?
- Be careful with interpreting aggregated data!

Check-In #2: Bar Plots and Faceting
========================================================
type: alert

- At this point you should have:
 - Created a bar plot for a single categorical variable
 - Created bar plots using multiple categorical variables
 - Learned how to improve the axis labels and main title of a graph

Part 3: Boxplots
========================================================
type: section

Mission #3: A Gap Between Red and Blue States?
========================================================
type: prompt

- A lot of researchers and pundits claim that there are fundamental differences between "red" and "blue" states
- We will look at a number of differences
- Between those states that went for McCain versus Obama, is there a difference in the percentage who went to college?


Creating Box Plots
========================================================
class: small-code

- These are also known as box-and-whisker plots
- They're great for examining the distribution of a continuous variable by levels of a categorical variable

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=HouseholdIncome, geom="boxplot")

qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=GSP, geom="boxplot")

qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=GSP, fill=ObamaMcCain, geom="boxplot")
```

Adding Points to Boxplots
========================================================

- We can also overlay the box plots wiht points using the `c()` function

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=HouseholdIncome, geom=c("boxplot","point"))

qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=HouseholdIncome, geom=c("boxplot","jitter"))

```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What is the difference between using `point` versus `jitter`?

Labeling Points
========================================================

- We can also label points using the `label` option and by specifying `text` as a geom object to be plotted
- The `size` option controls the size of the text labels
- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=HouseholdIncome, geom="boxplot")

qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, label=State, y=GSP, geom=c("boxplot","text")) 

```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - Which states are outliers?
 
Transforming a Variable
========================================================

- We can also transform a variable before plotting
- Often skewed distributions are logged

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=Population, geom="boxplot")

qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=Population, log="y", geom="boxplot") 
```

Challenge #3: A Gap Between Red and Blue States?
========================================================
type: prompt
incremental: true

- Between those states that went for McCain versus Obama, is there a difference in the percentage that went to college?

- **R Code** Hint:

```
qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=College, geom=c("boxplot","point"))

qplot(data=States, x=ObamaMcCain, y=College, label=State, geom=c("boxplot","text"))
```

- Which states have the lowest and highest levels of education for each level of the variable `ObamaMcCain`?

Check-In #3: Box Plots
========================================================
type: alert

- At this point you should have:
 - Generated box plots for a continuous variable across levels of a categorical variable
 - Placed points over a plot
 - Placed labels over a plot


Part 4: Scatter Plots
========================================================
type: section

Mission #4: Explaining State-Level Voting
========================================================
type: prompt

- Our data set has several numerical variables, including `HousedholdIncome`, `College`, and `NonWhite`
- Which of these variables do you think is most closely related to the percentage voting for Obama? 

Scatter Plot of Two Numerical Variables
========================================================
class: small-code

- We can also transform a variable before plotting
- Often skewed distributions are logged

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=College, y=HouseholdIncome, geom="point")
cor(States$College, States$HouseholdIncome)

qplot(data=States, x=College, y=NonWhite, geom="point")
cor(States$College, States$NonWhite)
```

- **Ask yourself**:
 - In what way does a scatter plot reveal more information than a correlation?

Adding a Line
========================================================
class: small-code
- We can add a smoothed line over the graph, which includes standard errors to represent sampling uncertainty

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=College, y=HouseholdIncome, geom=c("point","smooth"))

qplot(data=States, x=College, y=NonWhite, geom=c("point","smooth"))
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - Are the relationships between these variables roughly linear?

Labeling Points
========================================================
class: small-code
- We can also replace the points with text labels

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data=States, x=College, y=HouseholdIncome, label=State, geom=c("smooth", "text"))

qplot(data=States, x=College, y=NonWhite, label=State, geom=c("smooth", "text"))
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - Which states are outliers? 
 - Are there any unusual data points?

Challenge #4: Explaining State-Level Voting
========================================================
type: prompt
incremental: true
class: small-code

- Our data set has several numerical variables, including `HousedholdIncome`, `College`, and `NonWhite`
- Which of these variables do you think is most predictive of the percentage voting for Obama? 

- **R Code** Hint:

```
qplot(data=States, x=HouseholdIncome, y=ObamaVote, label=State, geom=c("text","smooth"))

qplot(data=States, x=College, y=ObamaVote, label=State, geom=c("text","smooth"))

qplot(data=States, x=NonWhite, y=ObamaVote, label=State, geom=c("text","smooth"))
```

Check-In #4: Scatter Plots
========================================================
type: alert

- At this point you should have:
 - Created a scatter plot between two numerical variables
 - Generated a smoothing line over a scatter plot
 - Overlaid a scatter plot with text labels


5. Spatial Mapping
========================================================
type: section

Mission #5: Which States are Red, Which States are Blue?
========================================================
type: prompt

- We will answer the question: which states are "red" and which states are "blue"?
- We can answer this question by looking at the raw data, but a visualization will be much easier to interpret
- Your goal is to create a map of the United States with information on the voting patterns


Grabbing Info on Latitude and Longitude
========================================================

- The ggplot2 function `map_data()` on latitude and longitude of U.S. states

- Try this **R Code**:

```
USAMap <- map_data("state")
str(USAMap)
View(USAMap)
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - What kind of information is in this data set?
 - How might this data set help us create a map?
 
Merging the Two Data Sets
========================================================

- Our goal is to merge these two data sets, which requires a common variable

- Try this **R Code**:

```
States$region <- tolower(States$State)

StatesMerged <- merge(x=USAMap, y=States, by = "region")

str(StatesMerged)
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - How many rows and columns are in `StatesMerged`?

Preparing for Mapmaking
========================================================

- The new data set `StatesMerged` also has information on latitude, longitude, and a variable called `order`
- This encodes information on how to draw the state boundaries
- We want the latitude and longitude values to be correctly sorted, so we will use the `order()` function
- This just sorts the rows into ascending order so that the map will be drawn correctly

Preparing for Mapmaking (cont.)
========================================================
class: small-code

- Try this **R Code**:

```
StatesMerged <- StatesMerged[order(StatesMerged$order), ]
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - Are we sorting the rows or columns?
 - What is the name of the data set and the variable that is being sorted?

Map of Household Income
========================================================
class: small-code

- Now we're ready to create a map!

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data = StatesMerged, x=long, y=lat, group = group, fill = HouseholdIncome, geom = "polygon")

```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - Which states have the highest income? How about the lowest?

More Maps with Differing Colors
========================================================
class: small-code

- Let's create some more maps! 
- We'll use `scale_fill_gradient()` to alter the color gradient

- Try this **R Code**:

```
qplot(data = StatesMerged, x=long, y=lat, group = group, fill = College, geom = "polygon") + scale_fill_gradient(low="red", high="green")
```
- **Ask yourself**:
 - Which states have the highest income? How about the lowest?


Challenge #5:  Which States are Red, Which States are Blue?
========================================================
type: prompt
incremental: false
class: small-code

- Which states are "red" and which states are "blue"?
- If you've followed along, then you should already have the data set ready!

- **R Code** Hint:

```
qplot(data = StatesMerged, x=long, y=lat, group = group, fill = ObamaVote, geom = "polygon") + scale_fill_gradient(low="red", high="blue")
```
- **Bonus**:
 - Wait, why are so many states purple or pink-ish?

Check-In #5: Spatial Mapping
========================================================
type: alert

- At this point you should have:
 - Loaded a data set with spatial information
 - Merged this data set with another data set
 - Created a map of U.S. states 
 - Altered the color scheme of the map
